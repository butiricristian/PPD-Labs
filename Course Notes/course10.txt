Distributed Programming

-no global shared memory(no global state) => communication via messages

- multiple nodes

    * star topology(bootleneck & if the central node fails the other nodes can;t communicate)
    * complete graph(n(n-1)/2 links)
    * hypercube topology( (n*logn)/2 links)

- socket()
    * issues with async, blocking..
    * setup the network of processes to communicate with each other
        1) who are the other processes
        2) authentication + security
    
MPI (message passing interface)


ssh-keygen
add the public key to autorized_keys file on the server
ssh-add private_key (on the client)
if agent is not working => ssh-agent bash
